# Space Race Dataset Analysis
This project involves an exploratory analysis of the Space Race dataset. The main goal is to explore historical data on space missions and understand trends, patterns, and key insights from the Space Race era.

## Project Objective
- Analyze the dataset to understand historical trends in space exploration.
- Visualize the distribution of missions, countries involved, and mission outcomes.
- Gain insights into how the Space Race evolved over time.

## Dataset
- Contains historical records of space missions, including launch dates, countries, mission types, and outcomes.
- Source: mission_launches.csv

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy for data manipulation
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization
- Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis

## Analysis Approach
- Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and formatting dates for easier analysis.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualizing the number of launches over time.
Analyzing contributions by different countries.
Exploring success/failure rates of missions.
- Insights: Observing trends and patterns in historical space missions (detailed in the notebook).
